- Actions
- Write a number of tests and fix them

- Get this to work
  const testMachine = createMachine(requestMachine);
  expect(testMachine.transition(testMachine.initialState, { type: 'route'}))

- Add guard before .target
- second param of target should be an action
- second param of on should be an action
- second param of matches should be an action



- I don't even think we need actions?
  - You call cond

- createMachine that uses Xstate
- Schema as typing for context and events
- Improve readme example

What is remaining before I can use this in my own projects?
- Actions
- Assign
- Invoke


Recreate the settings requestMachine and see if it's easier to:
1) Build
2) Recreate

----
Done
- Get new machine working
