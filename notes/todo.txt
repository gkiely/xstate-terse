- Get this to work
  const testMachine = createMachine(requestMachine);
  expect(testMachine.transition(testMachine.initialState, { type: 'route'}))
  
- Get typing working with existing methods
- Write a number of tests and fix them

- I don't even think we need actions?
  - You call cond

- createMachine that uses Xstate
- Schema as typing for context and events
- Improve readme example

What is remaining before I can use this in my own projects?
- Actions
- Assign
- Invoke


Done
- Get new machine working
